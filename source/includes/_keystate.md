# Rho.KeyStateThe KeyState API is used to display small icons to the user indicating the current shifted state of the hardware keyboard. The KeyState indicator will display icons for Shift, Alt, Control, Function, Caps, Num lock and Orange key states, growing from the right as necessary if more than one key state is set at once. This API is only supported on a subset of Symbol Technologies' Windows Mobile / CE / Embedded handheld devices (see remarks).## showStates{`WM`}Display keystate icons representing the shifted state of the hardware keyboard.## hideStates{`WM`}Stops showing keystate icons representing the shifted state of the hardware keyboard.
