# Rho.SimulScan## template{`Android`}The template XML which defines the document to be processed. This should be file URI to the template on the device. You must provide this property to define the form being captured and what is contained in each region on that form. Templates are specific to each document format you intend on capturing and can be created on-line at https://dpx-uat.motorolasolutions.com/.## audioFeedback{`Android`}Whether or not to provide audio feedback to the user following document processing.## debug{`Android`}If enabled, allows a session to write form capture, region images, region values, and other data to storage.## hapticFeedback{`Android`}Whether or not to provide haptic feedback to the user following document processing.## autoImageCapture{`Android`}If true, form will be captured automatically when detected. If false, user must manually tap screen or press trigger to capture the form.## frameThreshold{`Android`}Only used if autoImageCapture is enabled. The number of correct frames that is needed to pass before SimulScan Document Capture will automatically start to process form. This should be between 5 and 30.## negativeFrameThreshold{`Android`}Only used if autoImageCapture is enabled. Number of incorrect frames that is allowed to pass before the frame counter is reset for automatic image capture. This should be between 0 and 20.## delayResultDisplay{`Android`}If true, the success event will be sent only after the SimulScan Document Capture dialog is dismissed. If false, the event will be sent immediately after the results are ready. A false value is recommended unless direct interaction with the underlying application is necessary (e.g. keystroke input).## ledFeedback{`Android`}Whether or not to provide LED feedback to the user following document processing.## flashMode{`Android`}Flash mode (off, on, disabled).## identificationTimeout{`Android`}The length of time, in milliseconds that the processing engine has to recognize the image from the provided template. From 0 to 20000 in increments of 100.## inputSource{`Android`}Defines where the document should be captured from. The only supported source is camera.## templateDirectory{`Android`}Specify where to store downloaded templates. See [fetchTemplates()](#mfetchTemplates)## decodeAudioFeedback{`Android`}Specifies the decode sound (beep) that is heard when a form is decoded.## logDirectory{`Android`}Specify which directory to search for logs in.## processingTimeout{`Android`}Amount of time in milliseconds to wait before timing out processing.## version{`Android`}Version of SimulScan Document Capture engine.## uiResultConfirmation{`Android`}If enabled, shows a UI confirmation with results in SimulScan Document Capture View before sending results back to application.## captureDocument{`Android`}Capture a document by either taking a photo of it and process that image for fields defined in the template. You must specify the template associated with the capture either through the template property or as part of the propertyMap when calling this method. If the document processing does not succeed the returned callback will contain failure description. If the captured document is processed successfully a callback will contain document data.
				## fetchTemplates{`Android`}Fetch templates from dedicated SimulScan Document Capture server and place into template directory. See [templateDirectory property](#ptemplateDirectory). The device must have access to the network and can access the [SimulScan Document Capture Template Builder Website](http://dpx-uat.motorolasolutions.com)## getDataUri{`Android`}Return data URI encoding of the raw image associated with the region or captured form, this allows the operator to easily verify that the captured data is accurate and if necessary perform any post processing changes by hand. To show the image on the HTML page insert the data URI  string into the src attribute of the img tag:

		:::html
		<img src="dataURI string;">
				## close{`Android`}Close SimulScan Document Capture engine, and release allocated resources. When capturing images, this is especially important since they are made available temporarily.ailable temporarily.
