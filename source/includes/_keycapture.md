# Rho.KeyCaptureThe KeyCapture module is used to intercept or override hardware keys. It is typically used to provide certain application functions through the use of the device's physical keyboard or other hardware enabled buttons.## homeKeyValue{`WM`}Specifies a key which, when pressed, will navigate to the start page as defined in the RhoElements configuration. Set to 'Disabled' to prevent this behavior.## captureKey{`Android`, `WM`, `iOS`}Notifies the user when a specified physical key is pressed. The key event can also be absorbed so that it isn't delivered to the web view. If the callback is not set then the capture setting for the given key will be cleared.## remapKey{`Android`, `CE`, `WM`}Captures and consumes a specific key value and spawns a new key event with the remapped key code. If remapTo is empty or null, the remapping for this key value will be cleared.## captureTrigger{`Android`, `CE`, `WM`}Captures the event whenever a device hardware trigger is pressed or released. If the callback is not set then the capture setting for the trigger will be cleared. The trigger presses cannot be absorbed. All trigger presses will propagate to RhoElements.
